## Our Commitment to open source
While we're committed to open sourcing everything, there are some things we must have locked for security purposes. However, anything that isn't sensitive we're committing to as open source for our community to know we mean right by them. This allows the community to work help work on bugs, improvements, and even whole new features, should they wish.
Although the project is open source, we will not be provding any self-hosted features, due to the nature of how we've built and designed Doras.
For users who decide to help work on the codebase, we'll be rewarding them with a special badge onsite which they can choose to display or not. To those heavily committed to working on Doras and want to become full maintainers will be granted a "Community Liaison" badge which also unlocks all paid features as a thank you from us to you.
